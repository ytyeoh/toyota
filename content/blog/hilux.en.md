## PERFORMANCE
*Extreme Power with Enhanced Efficiency*
The heavy-duty turbocharger results in superior performance while the increased common-rail fuel injection pressure contributes to increased fuel efficiency. A 6-speed transmission delivers this power with a smooth driving feel.

1GD-FTV
2.8 L Intercooler
Electronic Common-rail Fuel Injection System
Max Power: 204 Horsepower
Max Torque: 500 Nm of torque

*Variable Flow Control (VFC) Power Steering*
Provides more natural handling that varies the assistance level to match high and low speeds.

*Auto Limited-slip Differential (LSD)*
When activated, the LSD maximises traction without limiting engine power if one of the rear wheels slips.

*Rear Differential Lock*
Improves traction in rough road conditions by providing equal torque to both rear wheels.

*Active Traction Control (A-TRC)*
When a wheel loses traction in 4WD mode, the system brakes that wheel and transfers power to the other wheel on the axle to maintain forward momentum.

*ECO / Power Drive Mode Selector*
ECO mode enhances the Hilux's fuel economy, while Power mode maximises performance.

*Downhill-assist Control (DAC)*
Controls the brakes automatically and prevents the Hilux from slipping when descending steep slopes.

## 360-T ADVANCED
Drive with confidence knowing that your Toyota is well-equipped with state-of-the-art features to optimise your journey. 360-T ensures that you remain safe, connected, and in control.

## SAFE-T
*Toyota Safety Sense
Pre-Collision System (PCS)* *
Avoids or mitigates frontal collisions by alerting the driver and automatically applies the brakes when there is a risk of collision.

*Driver remains solely responsible for safe driving at all times.

*Toyota Safety Sense
Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Yaw Assist* *
Alerts when you are out of the lane unintentionally and applies additional brake force to the inner wheels to correct your Hilux’s direction. Less swaying, safer driving.

*Driver remains solely responsible for safe driving at all times.
For illustration purposes only.

*Toyota Safety Sense
Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)* *
At speeds above 30 km/h, it maintains a safe distance with the preceding vehicle and brakes automatically when the car ahead slows down.

*Driver remains solely responsible for safe driving at all times.
For illustration purposes only.

*Panoramic View Monitor (PVM)* *
The 360° PVM allows you to be aware of hazards surrounding your Hilux. Useful when parking, especially in narrow and tight spaces.

*Optional accessory. Available for Double Cab variants only.

*Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) with Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)*
Detects vehicles that may not be visible to you when changing lanes or reversing, and alerts you.

*7 SRS Airbags*
Driver, front passenger, side, curtain shield and driver’s knee airbags provide complete protection for the driver and passengers in the event of a collision.

*Seat Belt Reminder*
Reminds all passengers to wear their seat belts.

*Security System*
Comprises a full range of security features such as an immobiliser, siren with back-up battery, an intrusion sensor, double locking and speed auto door lock.

*Hill-start Assist Control (HAC)*
Prevents the Hilux from rolling back when moving off up a steep slope, ensuring greater driving safety.

*Trailer Sway Control (TSC)*
When crosswinds, irregular road surfaces or sudden steering affects a towed trailer, the movement of the trailer is lessened so that it doesn’t go out of control.

*Emergency Stop Signal (ESS) and Brake Assist (BA)*
Sudden braking will cause the emergency signals of the Hilux to flash, to warn vehicles behind it, while BA ensures that maximum braking force is applied when an emergency is detected.

*Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with Traction Control (TRC)*
VSC prevents the Hilux from spinning when sudden manoeuvres are needed, while TRC improves traction when moving off/accelerating on slippery surfaces.

*Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD)*
ABS prevents wheel lock-up during braking while EBD optimally distributes braking power to each wheel according to the current load and weight.

## CONNECTIVI-T
9" Display Audio with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto™ Wireless Connectivity*
Access navigation and music options easily using your phone.
*Android Auto™ will be available when the service is officially launched in Malaysia.

Vehicle Telematics System (VTS)
An integrated system that monitors and shares your Hilux's real-time location through a mobile app.

## GUARAN-T
5-Year Warranty*
